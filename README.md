Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This app was designed for a user that wishes to keep track of their weight logs.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
In my final design I focused on trying to implement more fragment uses so that I would not make use of so many activities for some things that did not need it, that way that I could learn to implement one screen with multiple activites, which use fragments. My UI design was simple it was meant not to be overcomplicated , however, I am still developing this project WORK IN PROGRESS.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I applied the technique of creating a new project folder for separate modules of the application, often times i found that when I had the full UI design all together, it was easy to get lost and think, "This button needs this and it needs to do this and do this". Instead I went about thinking "Ok how can i make a fragment activity switch from add account to main menu", "How can i add a table", etc. and I slowly put all the components together.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested in various times slowly through running it and using many try and catch statements to make sure that it does not crash as often so that I can check the debug logs.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to innovate in the design of the user login database, initially i planned and coded an entire database that used an arraylist and tried to save to the internal memory, however, after doing so and then trying it on the emulator, i found i could not find the data. I searched and found that apparently(still unsure) that since it was I run the emulator I cannot access the internal memory through their with the simple method of openFileOutput and others.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think I successful in just implementing the fragments as I had a particulary hard time learning how to switch and send data but eventually got it.
